# **user discretion advised**

this is my attempt at a website to facilitate song-sharing between friends. 

as yet, it is still incredibly WIP — it is fairly insecure (who isn't!) and *very* barebones. 

the goal is to be able to friend people, and add songs to their 'queues', which they can then export to Spotify.

at the moment, the spotify integration is functional, but user authorization, registration, etc. are all missing.

### proceed at your own risk—lifeguard is *not* on duty!!
